# King County Property Values

## Key Question
What are the primary predictors for property values in king county?
How do those independent variables influence real value?

## Data Sources
1. [King County Assessor Data](http://info.kingcounty.gov/Assessor/DataDownload/default.aspx)
2. Explore engineering new features (like distance to nearest grocery store/school
  and nearby traffic conditions)
3. Possibly use [zillow data](http://www.zillow.com/research/data/#median-home-value)
as well
4. Explore other data sets for additional predictors if time permits.

## Spatial Database
I'm planning on setting up a spatially enabled database for faster easier feature
engineering since spatial operations would most likely be too slow in pandas
